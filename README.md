# Q - Get in Line!

Q is a queueing system designed specifically for the [Brown University](https://brown.edu/) [CS Department](http://cs.brown.edu/), inspired in large part by its predecessor, [SignMeUp](https://signmeup.cs.brown.edu/) ([source](https://github.com/signmeup/signmeup)).


## Getting Started

This is a Next.js app hosted on Vercel with a backend managed entirely through Firebase. To get started, ensure that you have Node, React, and `yarn` installed. Run `yarn` then `yarn dev` to start the development server. Note that without our API keys, you'll have to provision your own Firebase instance to do any development. Don't worry, it's free and easy to get started; [check out these startup docs for help](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start).
